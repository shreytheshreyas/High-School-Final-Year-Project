# High-School-Final-Year-Project (Memory Game)
This project was made by me and a friend of mine back in high school when we first grasped the basics of object oriented programming and 
data structures and algorithms one 1 year of experience in programming. The game is based on a video game released by nintendo for the nintendo DS gaming console, which was titled "Brain Age". Even though the program was coded in an outdated version of C++ (turbo c++), I look at this project as my first milestone as it persuaded me to take up computer engineering.
